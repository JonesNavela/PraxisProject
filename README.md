PHP, JavaScript Random Vehicle Registration Plates for Government (Final Year Project)

This is a web application that has a user login interface, then leads to a page 
where the user can click on a "Generate" button 
that will eventually generate 1 Million random vehicle number plates 
and allocates them to the 9 Provinces of South Africa and stores the information on a MySQL database.
